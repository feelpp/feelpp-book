Prerequisites 
=============

In order to use Feel++, users must be familiar with a several tools. 
In the following, we will briefly present them _via_
a simple project that performs basic arithmetic operations.

== Dummy project

The aim of this project is to sum, subtract, divide and multiply two numbers
given _via_ the command line using a C++ class.   

=== The project files are :

=== main.cpp   

[import](../../codes/prerequisites/main.cpp)

=== operation.cpp

[import](../../codes/prerequisites/operation.cpp)

=== operation.h

[import](../../codes/prerequisites/operation.h)

Using this project, we will present here : 

- How to compile the program using a link:makefile.adoc[MakeFile],
- How to make it simpler with link:cmake.adoc[CMake],
- How the code has to be link:doxygen.adoc[documented],
- What is git and link:github.adoc[GitHub].
