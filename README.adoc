== 1. Finite Element Embedded Library in C++ 

Feel\++ is a unified C++ implementation of Galerkin methods (finite and spectral element methods) in 1D, 2D and 3D to solve partial differential equations.

Feel++ is

 . a versatile mathematical kernel solving easily problems using
   different techniques thus allowing testing and comparing methods, e.g. cG versus dG.
   
 . a *small* and *manageable* library which nevertheless            encompasses a wide range of numerical methods and techniques     and in particular reduced order methods such as the reduced      basis method.
   
 . a software that follows closely the mathematical abstractions
   associated with partial differential equations (PDE) and in
   particular the finite element mathematical framework and
   variational formulations.
   
 . a library that offers solving strategies that scales up to
   thousands and even tens of thousands of cores.
   
 . a library entirely in `C++` allowing to create `C++` complex
   and typically non-linear multi-physics applications currently in industry, physics and health-care.


== 2. Help and Support

We're always happy to help out with Feel\++ or any other questions you might
have. You can ask a question or signal an issue at the Gitter Feel++ salon.

== 3. Contribute to this documentation

You can contribute to improve this documentation on
https://github.com/feelpp/feelpp-book[GitHub] and follow the
https://gitter.im/feelpp/feelpp-book[Gitter Feel++ Book] forum.


== 4. How to view the book

The book can be read online at https://book.feelpp.org/content

To compile the book on your machine.

1. Install gitbook library to get access to command tools. We recommend using
npm
```sh
npm install gitbook
```
2. Clone this repository. Place yourself in the repository directory, then
install the gitbook requirements. Finally, compile the book.
```sh
git clone git@github.com:feelpp/feelpp-book.git
cd feelpp-book
gitbook install
gitbook serve
```

3. Visualize the book in your browser, generally `http://localhost:4000`

**Remark:**

For more output format option, type
```
gitbook help
```

== 5. How to edit the book

Feel++ developers can edit the book online via https://www.gitbook.com.

But we recommend to proceed via **Pull Request** on the github repository

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add a new "upstream" remote which point to this repository
3. Set your master branch to point on this repository master branch.
4. Create and place yourself in a new branch for writting your change

```sh
git remote add upstream git://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout upstream/master -B master
git checkout -b branchname
```
5. Commit you change in your own branch, then create a pull-request targetting
the `prepub` branch.
6. Once the pull-request is accepted, you can delete your fork.
7. Once the `prepub` branch is reviewed, the new version is published to master.


== 6. How to write the book (convention)

All this book is written in asciidoc. Avoid using other format.
The book is divided in `Part`, `Chapters`, `Sections`.

=== 6.1 Chapters, sections

Each chapter is a directory named `<number>-<shortname>` where `<number>` respect the chapter
numbering. Each chapter contains a `README.adoc` files which contains the 
table of content for the whole chapter similar to the file `SUMMARY.adoc`.

.Example of chapter
```sh
03-mychapter/README.adoc    # chapter toc
03-mychapter/01-myfirstsection.adoc
03-mychapter/02-mysecondsection.adoc
```
If the section contains many big subsection, proceed the same way.

.Example of big section

```sh
03-mychapter/README.adoc                 # chapter toc
03-mychapter/01-mysection/README.adoc    # section toc
03-mychapter/01-mysection/01-subsection.adoc
```

See existing files in the book to well understand the book structure before editing any files.

=== 6.2 Codes

To keep the book look coherent, we use two plugins for source codes:
- .link:https://github.com/azu/gitbook-plugin-include-codeblock[gitbook-plugin-include-codeblock]
- .link:https://github.com/ymcatar/gitbook-plugin-ace[gitbook-plugin-ace]
Note that `include-codeblock` use `ace`, see their documentation for more details.
The styling option are set globally, please do not change them with local commands.

==== 6.2.1 Include codes (recommended)

In most case, we recommend keeping code aside from the book, and include it using snippet
features of `include-codeblock`. Do include a code, just use

```sh
[include,lang:"feelpp"](path/to/file.cpp)
```

If the code contains doxygen snippet tag, you can call inner code using this way

```sh
[include:"tag",lang:"feelpp"](path/to/file.cpp)
```
Note that if you do not pass the `lang` key, it will determine the syntax from
file extension, so in this case C++.

==== 6.2.2 Inner codes

If the code is really short, you can write it directly in the asciidoc file.
We ask you to avoid this practice if it can be avoided.
```sh
{%ace lang:"feelpp"}
    // your code
{%endace}
```
It detect automatically the C++ syntax + feelpp syntax
(.link:https://github.com/gdolle/gitbook-plugin-ace-mode-feelpp[ace-mode-feelpp]
plugin)

=== 6.3 Math

There're many ways to write math formula. We ask you to use this latex delimiters
`\( \)` and `\[ \]` for keeping latex and asciidoctor compatibility.

**You might have to escape these delimiters with `\` and write `\\( \\)` or
`\\[ \\]` instead! See other source codes**

Example of usage:
```
This is an inline formula \( \lambda \) math
This is an block formula
\[
    \lambda
\]
```
