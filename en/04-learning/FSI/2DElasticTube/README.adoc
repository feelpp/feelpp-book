This test case has originally been realised by
link:{biblio}#pena09:_high_order_method_in_space[Pena],
link:{biblio}#nobile2001numerical[Nobile] and
link:{biblio}#gerbeau2003quasi[GerbeauVidrascu] only with the free outlet
condition.

Computer codes, used for the acquisition of results, are from Vincent
link:{biblio}#bloodflowChabannes[Chabannes].

== Problem Description 

We interest here to the case of bidimensional blood flow modelisation. We want
to reproduce and observe pressure wave spread into a canal with a
link:../readme.adoc#_fluid_structure_model[fluid-structure interaction model].


[[img-geometry1]]
image::ElasticTube.png[caption="Figure 1 : ", title="Geometry of two-dimension elastic tube.", alt="Elastic Tube Geometry", width="600", align="center"]  

The figure above shows us the initial geometry we will work on. The canal is
represent by a rectangle with width and height, respectively  equal to 6 and 1
cm. The upper and lower walls are mobile and so, can be moved by flow action.

By using the link:../../CSM/readme.adoc#_axisymmetric_reduced_model[1D reduced
model], named generalized string and explained by
link:{biblio}#bloodflowChabannes[Chabannes], we didn't need to define the
elastic domain ( for the vascular wall ) here. So the structure domain is
$$\Omega_s^*=\Gamma_{fsi}^*$$

During this benchmark, we will compare two different cases : the free outlet
condition and the Windkessel model. The first one, as its name said, impose a
free condition on the fluid at the end of the domain. The second one is used to
model more realistically an flow outlet into our case. The chosen time step is
$$\Delta t=0.0001$$

=== Boundary conditions 

We set :

* on $$\Gamma_f^{i,*}$$ the pressure wave pulse

$$
\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{f} \boldsymbol{n}_f =
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
    & \left(-\frac{2 \cdot 10^4}{2} \left( 1 - \cos \left(  \frac{ \pi t} {2.5 \cdot 10^{-3}} \right) \right), 0\right)^T  \quad & \text{ si } t < 0.005 \\
    & \boldsymbol{0} \quad & \text{ sinon }
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
$$

* on $$\Gamma_f^{o,*}$$
    - Case 1 : free outlet
    $$
    \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{f} \boldsymbol{n}_f =0
    $$
    - Case 2 : Windkessel model ( $$P_0$$ proximal pressure, see link:{biblio}#bloodflowChabannes[Chabannes] )
    $$
    \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{f} \boldsymbol{n}_f = -P_0\boldsymbol{n}_f
    $$

* on $$\Gamma_f^{i,*}$$ U $$\Gamma_f^{o,*}$$ a null displacement

$$
\boldsymbol{\eta}_f=0
$$

* on $$\Gamma^*_{fsi}$$ 

$$
\eta_s=0
$$

* We add also the link:../../CSM/readme.adoc#_axisymmetric_reduced_model[specific coupling conditions], obtained from the axisymmetric reduced model, on $$\Gamma^*_{fsi}$$ 

$$
\dot{\eta}_s \boldsymbol{e}_r - \boldsymbol{u}_f = \boldsymbol{0}
$$

$$
f_s  + \left(J_{\mathcal{A}_f^t} \boldsymbol{F}_{\mathcal{A}_f^t}^{-T} \hat{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}_f \boldsymbol{n}^*_f\right) \cdot \boldsymbol{e}_r
=  0
$$

$$
\boldsymbol{\varphi}_s^t  - \mathcal{A}_f^t = \boldsymbol{0}
$$

== Outputs

After solving the link:../readme.adoc#_fluid_structure_model[fluid struture model], we obtain $$(\mathcal{A}^t, \boldsymbol{u}_f, p_f, \boldsymbol{\eta}_s)$$ 

with $$\mathcal{A}^t$$ the ALE map, $$\boldsymbol{u}_f$$ the fluid velocity,
$$p_f$$ the fluid pressure and $$\boldsymbol\eta_s$$ the structure displacement


== Discretization

$$\mathcal{F}$$ is the set of all mesh faces, we denote $$\mathcal{F}_{stab}$$
the face we stabilize 
$$
\mathcal{F}_{stab} = \mathcal{F} \bigcap \left( \left\{ (x,y) \in \mathrm{R}^2:
(x - 0.3) \leqslant 0 \right\} \cup  \left\{ (x,y) \in \mathrm{^2: (x - 5.7) }
\geqslant 0   \right\} \right)
$$

In fact, after a first attempt, numerical instabilities can be observed at the
fluid inlet. These instabilities, caused by pressure wave, and especially by
the Neumann condition, make our fluid-structure solver diverge.

To correct them, we choose to add a stabilization term, obtain from the
stabilized CIP formulation ( see link:{biblio}#bloodflowChabannes[Chabannes]
Chapter 6 ).

As this stabilization bring an important cost with it, by increasing the number
of non-null term into the problem matrix, we only apply it at the fluid
entrance, where the instabilities are located. 


Now we present the different situations we worked on.

For the fluid time discretization, BDF, at order $$2$$, is the method we use.

And Newmark-beta method is the one we choose for the structure time
discretization, with parameters $$\gamma=0.5$$ and $$\beta=0.25$$.

These methods can be retrieved in link:{biblio}#bloodflowChabannes[Chabannes] papers.

== Implementation 

To realize the acquisition of the benchmark results, code files contained and
using the Feel++ library will be used. Here is a quick look to the different
location of them.

Let's start with the main code, that can be retrieve in

----
    feelpp/applications/models/fsi
----

The configuration file associated to this test is named wavepressure2d.cfg and
is located at 

----
    feelpp/applications/models/fsi/wavepressure2d
----

The result files are then stored by default in 

----
    applications/models/fsi/wavepressure2d/P2P1G1-P1G1/np_1
----


== Results

The two following pictures have their pressure and velocity magnitude amplify by 5.

=== Conclusion 

Let's begin with results with the free outlet condition ( see figure 2 ). These
pictures show us how the pressure wave progresses into the tube. We can denote
an increase of the fluid velocity at the end of the tube. Also, the wave eases
at the same place. For the simulation with the Windkessel model, we observe a
similar comportment at the beginning ( see figure 3 ). However, the outlet is
more realistic than before. In fact, the pressure seems to propagate more
naturally with this model. + In the two cases, the velocity field is disturbed
at the fluid-structure interface. A mesh refinement around this region
increases the quality. However, this is not crucial for the blood flow
simulation.

Now we can interest us to the quantitative results.

The inflow and outflow evolution figure ( see figure 4 ) shows us similarities
for the two tests at the inlet. At the outlet, in contrast, the flow increases
for the free outlet condition. In fact, when the pressure wave arrived at
the outlet of the tube, it is reflected to the other way. In the same
way, when the reflected wave arrived at the inlet, it is reflected
again. The Windkessel model reduce significantly this phenomenon. Some
residues stay due to 0D coupling model and structure fixation.

We also have calculate the maximum displacement magnitude for the two model (
see figure 5 ). The same phenomenons explained ahead are retrieve here. We
denote that, for the free outlet, the structure undergoes movements during the
test time, caused by the wave reflection. The Windkessel model reduces these
perturbations thanks to the 0D model.

The average pressure and the fluid flow ( see figure 6 and 7 ) show us the same
non-physiological phenomenons as before. The results we obtain are in
accordance with the ones proposed by link:{biblio}#nobile2001numerical[Nobile].

To end this benchmark, we will compare the two resolution algorithms used with
the fluid-structure model : the implicit and the semi-implicit ones. The
link:readme.adoc#Discretization[second configuration] with Windkessel model is
used for the measures. 

We have then the fluid flow and the displacement magnitude ( figure 8 ) curves,
which superimposed on each other. So the  accuracy obtained by the
semi-implicit method  seems good here. 

The performances of the two algorithms ( figure 9 ) are expressed from number
of iterations and CPU time at each step time. The semi-implicit method is a bit
ahead of the implicit one on number of iterations. However, the CPU time is
smaller for 2 or 3 time,  due to optimization in this method. First an unique
ALE map estimation is need. Furthermore, linear terms of the Jacobian matrix,
residuals terms and dependent part of the ALE map can be stored and reused at
each iteration.
