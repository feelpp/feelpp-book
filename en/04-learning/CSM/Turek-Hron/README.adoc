Turek Hron CSM Benchmark
========================

:biblio: ../../Appendix/Bibliography/readme.adoc 

In order to validate our fluid-structure interaction solver, we realize here a benchmark on the deformation of an elastic structure, initially proposed by link:{biblio}#turek2006proposal[Turek and Hron].

Computer codes, used for the acquisition of results, are from Vincent link:{biblio}#bloodflowChabannes[Chabannes].

> **Note** This benchmark is linked to the link:../../CFD/Turek-Hron/readme.adoc[Turek Hron CFD] and link:../../FSI/Turek-Hron/readme.adoc[Turek Hron FSI ] benchmarks.

== Problem Description

We consider a solid structure, composed of a hyperelastic bar, bound to one of his extremity $$\Gamma_F^*$$ to a rigid stationary circular structure. We denote $$\Gamma_{L}^*=\partial\Omega_s^* \backslash \Gamma_F^*$$ the other boundaries. 
The geometry can be represented as follows

[[img-geometry1]]
image::TurekHronCSMGeometry.png[caption="Figure 1 : ", title="Geometry of the Turek & Hron CSM benchmark.", alt="CSM Geometry", width="500", align="center"]

$$\Omega_s^*$$ represent the initial domain, before any deformations. We denote $$\Omega^t_s$$ the domain obtained during the deformations application, at the time t.

By link:../readme.adoc#_Second_Newton's_law[ the Newton's second law], we can describe the fundamental equation of the solid mechanic in a Lagrangian frame. Furthermore, we will suppose that the hyperelastic material follows a link:../readme.adoc#_Compressible_Saint-Venant-Kirchhoff_model[ compressible Saint-Venant-Kirchhoff model]. The link:../readme.adoc#_Lamé_coefficients[ Lamé coefficients], used in this model, are deducing from the Young's modulus $$E_s$$ and the Poisson's ratio $$\nu_s$$ of the material.


We will observe, during this simulation, the displacement of $$A$$, on the $$x$$ and $$y$$ axis, when the elastic structure is subjected to its own weight, and compare our results to the reference ones given Turek and Hron.

In the first two cases, CSM1 and CSM2, we want to determine the steady state condition. To find it, a quasi-static algorithm is used, which increase at each step the gravity parameter. 

For the third cases, CSM3, we realise a transient simulation, where we will observe the comportment of $$A$$ subjected to its weight during a given time span.

=== Boundary conditions

We set

* on $$\Gamma_{F}^*$$, a condition that imposes this boundary to be fixed.
$$
  \boldsymbol{\eta}_s=0
$$

* on $$\Gamma_{L}^*$$, a condition that lets these boundaries be free from constraints.
$$
  (\boldsymbol{F}_s\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_s)\boldsymbol{n}^*_s=\boldsymbol{0}
$$

where $$\boldsymbol{n}_s^*$$ is the outer unit normal vector from $$\partial \Omega_s^*$$.

=== Initial conditions

The source term $$\boldsymbol{f}_s$$, chosen in order to set in motion the elastic structure, is define by 

$$
\boldsymbol{f}_s=(0,-\rho^*_s g)
$$

where $$g$$ is a gravitational constant.

The reference document ( link:{biblio}#turek2006proposal[Turek and Hron] ) don't specify the time interval used to obtain their results. In our case, it's chosen as $$[0,10]$$.

== Inputs

The following table displays the various fixed and variables
parameters of this test-case.

.Fixed and Variable Input Parameters
|===
| Name |Description | Nominal Value | Units

|$$g$$| gravitational constant | 2 | $$m / s^2$$
|$$l$$ | elastic structure length | $$0.35$$  |$$m$$
|$$h$$ | elastic structure height | $$0.02$$  |$$m$$ |
$$r$$ | cylinder radius | $$0.05$$  |$$m$$
|$$C$$ | cylinder center coordinates | $$(0.2,0.2)$$|$$m$$
|$$A$$ | control point coordinates | $$(0.2,0.2)$$|$$m$$
|$$B$$ | point coordinates | $$(0.15,0.2)$$|$$m$$
|$$E_s$$ | Young's modulus | $$1.4\times 10^6$$  | $$kg / ms^2$$
|$$\nu_s$$ | Poisson's ratio | $$0.4$$  |dimensionless
|$$\rho^*_s$$ | density | $$1000$$  |$$kg/ m^3$$
|===

As for solvers we used, Newton's method is chosen for the non-linear part and a direct method based on LU decomposition is selected for the linear part.

== Outputs

As described before, we have 

$$
\rho^*_s \frac{\partial^2\boldsymbol{\eta}_s}{\partial t^2} - \nabla \cdot (\boldsymbol{F}_s\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_s) = \boldsymbol{f}^t_s
$$

We search the displacement $$\boldsymbol{\eta}_s$$, on $$\Omega_s^*$$, which will satisfy this equation.

In particular, the displacement of the point $$A$$ is the one that interests us.

== Discretization

To realize these tests, we made the choice to used Finite Elements Method, with Lagrangian elements of order $$N$$ to discretize space.

Newmark-beta method, presented into link:{biblio}#bloodflowChabannes[Chabannes] papers, is the one we used for the time discretization. We used this method with $$\gamma=0.5$$ and $$\beta=0.25$$.

== Implementation

To realize the acquisition of the benchmark results, code files contained and using the Feel++ library will be used. Here is a quick look to the different location of them.

First at all, the main code can be found in

----
    feelpp/applications/models/solid
----

The configuration file for the CSM3 case, the only one we work on, is located at 

----
    feelpp/applications/models/solid/TurekHron
----

The result files are then stored by default in 

----
    feel/applications/models/solid/TurekHron/csm3/"OrderDisp""Geometric_order"/"processor_used"
----

Like that, for the CSM3 case executed on $$8$$ processors, with a $$P_1$$ displacement approximation space and a geometric order of $$1$$, the path is 

----
    feel/applications/models/solid/TurekHron/csm3/P1G1/np_8
----


At least, to retrieve results that interested us for the benchmark and to generate graphs, we use a Python script located at 

----
    feelpp-benchmarking-book/CFD/Turek-Hron/postprocess_cfd.py

=== Conclusion

To obtain these data, we used several different mesh refinements and different polynomial approximations for the displacement on the time interval $$[0,10]$$.

Our results are pretty similar to those from Turek and Hron, despite a small gap. This gap can be caused by the difference between our time interval and the one used for the reference acquisitions.
