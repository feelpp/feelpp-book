NAFEMS LE1 Benchmarck
======================

This benchmark is extract from the link:http://things.maths.cam.ac.uk/computing/software/abaqus_docs/docs/v6.12/pdf_books/BENCHMARKS.pdf[Abaqus Benchmarks Manual].

== Definition

We focus on the link:http://www.caesarsystems.co.uk/NAFEMS_benchmarks/le1.html[LE1] benchmarks in particular.

=== Geometry

The geometry is given link:http://www.caesarsystems.co.uk/NAFEMS_benchmarks/le1.html[here] by : +

=== Boundary conditions

We set:

- $$u_y = 0$$ on $$DC$$
- $$u_x = 0$$ on $$AB$$
- $$\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}\cdot\mathbf{n}=1e^7$$ on $$BC$$.

== Inputs

We have the following parameters:

.Inputs
|===
| Name | Value

|$$E$$ | $$210\, GPa$$
|$$\nu$$ | $$0.3$$
|$$\rho$$ | $$7800\, kg/m^2$$
|===

== Outputs

We want to compare the value of $$\sigma_{yy}$$ at the point $$D$$. The reference value is $$92.7\, MPa$$.

== Results

The value of $$\sigma_{yy}$$ at the point $$D$$ is $$94.09\, MPa$$ for $$32 000$$ dofs, which is $$1.49%$$ higher than the target.

One possibility to get a more accurate output is to use a mixed formulation, where the stress tensor would also be an unknown.
