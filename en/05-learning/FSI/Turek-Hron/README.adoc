In order to validate our fluid-structure interaction solver, a benchmark, initially proposed by link:{biblio}#turek2006proposal[Turek and Hron], is realized.

Computer codes, used for the acquisition of results, are from Vincent link:../../Appendix/Bibliography/readme.adoc#bloodflowChabannes[Chabannes].

> **Note** This benchmark is linked to the link:../../CFD/Turek-Hron/readme.adoc[Turek Hron CFD] and link:../../CSM/Turek-Hron/readme.adoc[Turek Hron CSM ] benchmarks.

== Problem Description

In this case, we want to study the flow of a laminar incrompressible flow around an elastic obstacle, fixed to a rigid cylinder, we combine here the study realized on link:../../CFD/Turek-Hron/readme.adoc[Turek Hron CFD benchmark] and link:../../CFD/Turek-Hron/readme.adoc[Turek Hron CSM benchmark].
So a 2D model, representative of this state, is consider.

We denote $$\Omega_f^*$$ the fluid domain, represented by a rectangle of dimension $$[0,2.5] \times [0,0.41] $$. This domain is characterized by its density $$\rho_f$$ and its dynamic viscosity $$\mu_f$$. In this case, the fluid material we used is glycerin.

Furthermore, the model chosen to describe the flow is the incompressible Navier-Stockes model. It is defined by the conservation of momentum equation and the conservation of mass equation. We also have the material constitutive equation to take in account in this domain, as well as the harmonic extension operator for the fluid movement.

On the other side, the structure domain, named $$\Omega_s^*$$, represent the hyperelastic bar, bound to the stationary cylinder. As we want to work in a Lagrangian frame, and by Newton's second law, the fundamental equation of the solid mechanic will be used. For the model, that our hyperelastic material follows, we use the Saint-Venant-Kirchhoff one, define with Lamé coefficients. These coefficients are obtained from the the Young's modulus $$E_s$$ and the Poisson's ratio $$\nu_s$$ of the material.

All of these are then gather into the fluid-structure coupling system.

=== Boundary conditions

We set

* on $$\Gamma_{in}^*$$, an inflow Dirichlet condition.
$$
  \boldsymbol{u}_f=(v_{in},0);
$$

* on $$\Gamma_{wall}^*$$ and $$\Gamma_{circ}^*$$, a homogeneous Dirichlet condition. 
$$
  \boldsymbol{u}_f=\boldsymbol{0};
$$

* on $$\Gamma_{out}^*$$, a Neumann condition
$$
  \boldsymbol{\sigma}_f\boldsymbol{n}_f=\boldsymbol{0};
$$

* on $$\Gamma_{fixe}^*$$, a condition that imposes this boundary to be fixed.
$$
  \boldsymbol{\eta}_s=0
$$

* on $$\Gamma_{fsi}^*$$

$$
\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\eta_{s}} }{\partial t} - \boldsymbol{u}_f \circ \mathcal{A}^t_f
  = \boldsymbol{0} \quad \left( \text{Velocities continuity}\right) 
$$
$$
  \boldsymbol{F}_{s} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{s} \boldsymbol{n}^*_s + J_{\mathcal{A}^t_f} \boldsymbol{F}_{\mathcal{A}^t_f}^{-T} \hat{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}_f \boldsymbol{n}^*_f
  = \boldsymbol{0} \quad \left( \text{ Constraint continuity}\right) 
$$

$$
  \boldsymbol{\varphi}_s^t  - \mathcal{A}^t_f
  = \boldsymbol{0} \quad \left( \text{Geometric continuity}\right) 
$$

where $$\boldsymbol{n}_f$$ is the outer unit normal vector from $$\partial \Omega_f^*$$.

=== Initial conditions

==== Fluid 
In order to describe the flow inlet by $$\Gamma_{in}$$, a parabolic velocity profile is used. It can be expressed by

$$
  v_{cst} = 1.5 \bar{U} \frac{4}{0.1681} y \left(0.41-y\right)
$$
where $$\bar{U}$$ is the mean inflow velocity.

However, to impose a progressive increase of this velocity profile, we define
$$
  v_{in} =
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
   & v_{cst} \frac{1-\cos\left( \frac{\pi}{2} t \right) }{2}  \quad & \text{ if } t < 2 \\
   & v_{cst}  \quad & \text{ otherwise }
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
$$

With t the time.

Finally, we don't want a source term, so $$f_f\equiv 0$$.

|===

As for solvers we used, Newton's method is chosen for the non-linear part and a direct method based on LU decomposition is selected for the linear part.

== Outputs

The quantities we observe during this benchmark are on one hand the lift and drag forces ( respectively $$F_L$$ and $$F_D$$ ), as well as the displacement, on $$x$$ and $$y$$ axis, of the point A is the second value that interest us here.

They are the solution of the link::../readme.adoc#_fluid_structure_model[fluid-structure system].

This system also give us the ALE map $$\mathcal{A}_f^t$$.

== Discretization

To realize these tests, we made the choice to used $$P_N$$-$$P_{N-1}$$ Taylor-Hood finite elements to discretize the space.

For the fluid time discretization, BDF, at order $$q$$, is the method we have chosen.

And finally Newmark-beta method is the one we used for the structure time discretization, with parameters $$\gamma=0.5$$ and $$\beta=0.25$$.

These methods can be retrieved in link:../../Appendix/Bibliography/readme.adoc#bloodflowChabannes[Chabannes] papers.

== Implementation

To realize the acquisition of the benchmark results, code files contained and using the Feel++ library will be used. Here is a quick look to the different location of them.

Let's start with the main code, that can be retrieve in

----
    feelpp/applications/models/fsi
----

The FSI3 configuration file is located at 

----
    feelpp/applications/models/fsi/TurekHron
----

The result files are then stored by default in 

----
    feel/applications/models/fsi/TurekHron/fsi3/
    velocity_space""pression_space""Geometric_order"-"OrderDisp""Geometric_order"/"processor_used"
----

For example, for the FSI3 case executed on $$4$$ processors, with a $$P_2$$ velocity approximation space, a $$P_1$$ pressure approximation space, a geometric order of $$1$$ for fluid part and a $$P_1$$ displacement approximation space and geometric order equals to $$1$$ for solid part, the path is

=== Conclusion

Our first three results are quite similar to given references values. That show us that high order approximation order for space and time give us accurate values, while allow us to use less degree of freedom.

However, the lift force seems to undergo some disturbances, compared to reference results, and it's more noticeable in our fourth case.
This phenomenon is describe by <<Beuer>>, where they're explaining these disturbances are caused by Aitken dynamic relaxation, used in fluid structure relation for the fixed point algorithm.

In order to correct them, they propose to lower the fixed point tolerance, but this method also lowers calculation performances. An other method to solve this deviation is to use a fixed relaxation parameter $$\theta$$. In this case, the optimal $$\theta$$ seems to be equal to $$0.5$$.
