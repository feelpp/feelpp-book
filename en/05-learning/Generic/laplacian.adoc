== Problem statement

We are interested in this section in the _conforming finite element approximation_ of the following problem:

[[laplacian]]
.Laplacian problem
****
Look for $$u$$ such that                              

$$     
\left\{\begin{split}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
     -\Delta u &= f \text{ in } \Omega\\                                                                                                                                       
      u &= g \text{ on } \partial \Omega_D\\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} &=h \text{ on } \partial \Omega_N\\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} + u &=l \text{ on } \partial \Omega_R
 \end{split}\right.
$$

CAUTION: $$\partial \Omega_D$$, $$\partial \Omega_N$$ and $$\partial \Omega_R$$ can be empty sets. In the case $$\partial \Omega_D =\partial \Omega_R = \emptyset$$, then the solution is known up to a constant.

[NOTE]
======
In the implementation presented later, $$\partial \Omega_D =\partial \Omega_N = \partial \Omega_R = \emptyset$$, then we set Dirichlet boundary conditions all over the boundary. The problem then reads like a standard laplacian with inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions:

Look for $$u$$ such that                              

$$                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
-\Delta u = f\ \text{ in } \Omega,\quad u = g \text{ on } \partial \Omega
$$

== Variational formulation

We assume that $$f, h, l \in L^2(\Omega)$$. The weak formulation of the problem then reads:                                                                                                                                            

.Laplacian problem variational formulation
****
Look for $$u \in H^1_{g,\Gamma_D}(\Omega)$$ such that                                                                                                                                    

$$                                                                                                                                                           
\displaystyle\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v +\int_{\Gamma_R} u v = \displaystyle \int_\Omega f\ v+ \int_{\Gamma_N} g\ v + \int_{\Gamma_R} l\ v,\quad \forall v \in H^1_{0,\Gamma_D}(\Omega)

== Conforming Approximation
                                                                                                                                                            
We now turn to the finite element approximation using Lagrange finite element. We assume $$\Omega$$ to be a segment in 1D, a polygon in 2D or a polyhedron in 3D.   
We denote $$V_\delta  \subset H^1(\Omega)$$ an approximation space such that $$V_{g,\delta} \equiv P^k_{c,\delta}\cap H^1_{g,\Gamma_D}(\Omega) $$.

The weak formulation reads: 

.Laplacian problem weak formulation
****
Look for $$u_\delta \in V_\delta  $$ such that                                                                                                                                    

$$                                                                                                                                                           
\displaystyle\int_{\Omega_\delta} \nabla u_{\delta} \cdot \nabla v_\delta +\int_{\Gamma_{R,\delta}} u_\delta\ v_\delta = \displaystyle \int_{\Omega_\delta} f\ v_\delta+ \int_{\Gamma_{N,\delta}} g\ v_\delta + \int_{\Gamma_{R,\delta}} l\ v_\delta,\quad \forall v_\delta \in V_{0,\delta}                                                      
$$

NOTE: from now on, we omit $$\delta$$ to lighten the notations. Be careful that it appears both the geometrical and approximation level.



[[implementation]]
== Feel++ Implementation   

In Feel{plus}{plus},  $$V_{g,\delta}$$ is not built but rather                                                                                                                 
$$P^k_{c,\delta}$$. 

NOTE: The Dirichlet boundary conditions can be treated using different techniques and we use from now on the elimination technique.

We start with the mesh

[include:"mesh"](qs_laplacian.cpp)


NOTE: the keyword `auto` enables type inference, for more details see link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11#Type_inference[Wikipedia C{plus}{plus}11 page]. 


Next the discretization setting by first defining `Vh=Pch<k>(mesh)` $$\equiv P^k_{c,h}$$, then elements of `Vh` and expressions `f`, `n` and `g` given by command line options or configuration file.

[include:"discr"](qs_laplacian.cpp)

[NOTE]
======
at the following line
[include:"v"](qs_laplacian.cpp)
`v` is set to the expression `g`, which means more precisely that `v` is the interpolant of `g` in `Vh`. 
======

the variational formulation is implemented below, we define the bilinear form `a` and linear form `l` and we set _strongly_ the Dirichlet boundary conditions with the keyword `on` using elimination. If we don't find  `Dirichlet`, `Neumann` or `Robin` in the list of physical markers in the mesh data structure then we impose Dirichlet boundary conditions all over the boundary.

[include:"vf"](qs_laplacian.cpp)

[NOTE]
======
We have the following correspondance:

|===
| Element sets  | Domain

| `elements(mesh)` | $$\Omega$$ 
| `boundaryfaces(mesh)` | $$\partial \Omega$$ 

| `markfaces(mesh,"Dirichlet")`  |  $$\Gamma_D$$
| `markfaces(mesh,"Neumann")`  |  $$\Gamma_R$$
| `markfaces(mesh,"Robin")`  |  $$\Gamma_R$$

|===

======

next we solve the algebraic problem

.Listing: solve algebraic system
[include:"solve"](qs_laplacian.cpp)

next we compute the $$L^2$$ norm of $$u_\delta-g$$, it could serve 
as an $$L^2$$ error if $$g$$ was manufactured to be the exact solution of the <<laplacian>>.

[include:"ug"](qs_laplacian.cpp)


and finally we export the results, by default it is in the ensight  gold format and the files can be read with Paraview and Ensight. We save both $$u$$ and $$g$$.

.Listing: export Laplacian results
[include:"export"](qs_laplacian.cpp)

== Testcases

The <<implementation>> comes with testcases in 2D and 3D.

=== circle

`circle` is a 2D testcase where $$\Omega$$ is a disk whose boundary has been split such that $$\partial \Omega=\partial \Omega_D \cup \partial \Omega_N \cup \partial \Omega_R$$.

Here are some results we can observe after use the following command

[source,bash]
----
cd Testcases/quickstart/circle
mpirun -np 4 /usr/local/bin/feelpp_qs_laplacian_2d --config-file circle.cfg
----

This give us some data such as solution of our problem or the mesh used in the application.
