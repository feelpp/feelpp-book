Feel{plus}+ generates various files that are spread over various directories.
For this tutorial, it would be beneficial to check the content of these files
to familiarize yourself with Feel{plus}+.

== Environment variables

Some of Feel++ behavior can be driven by environment variables such as

 * FEELPP_REPOSITORY
 * FEELPP_WORKDIR

Both variables should point to the same place. They define the root directory where the simulation results will be stored. By default they are set to `$HOME/feel`. 

If you want to change the root directory where the results are stored, define e.g. FEELPP_REPOSITORY. For example in the docker image `feel/apps:latest`, it points to `/feel`.

For running,
[source,shell]
----
docker run -it -v $HOME/feel:/feel feelpp/apps:latest
----
should get you this output
[source,shell]

# Feel++ applications

This image provides the Feel++ applications in
 . advection
 . fluid mechanics
 . solid mechanics
 . fluid-structure interaction
 . thermodynamics
The testcases are in $HOME/Testcases/ and the results are in
$HOME/feel

Follow the steps described in

http://book.feelpp.org/content/Applications/Models/readme.html

to use the models.

feelpp@50381de2bd23:~$ 
----

and here is the result of `echo $FEELPP_REPOSITORY` in the docker image
[source,shell]
----
feelpp@50381de2bd23:~$ echo $FEELPP_REPOSITORY 
/feel
----

== Results

- Results `$FEELPP_REPOSITORY/feel/<your_app_name>/np_1`

== Log files

Feel++ uses https://github.com/google/glog[Google Glog].  

  
- Log files : `$FEELPP_REPOSITORY/feel/<your_app_name>/np_1/logs` 

-  Mesh : `$FEELPP_REPOSITORY/feel/<your_app_name>/np_1`   

- Config files : `$FEELPP_REPOSITORY/<your_build_folder>/doc/manual/tutorial`
