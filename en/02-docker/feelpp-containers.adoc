Feel++ leverages the power of Docker and provides a stack of container images.

== First steps

To test Docker is installed properly, try
[source,bash]
----
$ docker run feelpp/feelpp-env  echo "Hello World!"
----

This may take a while depending on your internet connection but eventually you should see something like

[source,txt]
----
Unable to find image 'feelpp/feelpp-env:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from feelpp/feelpp-env
8e21f82d32cf: Pull complete 
[...]
0a8dee947f9b: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:457539dbd781594eccd4ddf26a7aefdf08a2fff9dbeb1f601a22d9e7e3761fbc
Status: Downloaded newer image for feelpp/feelpp-env:latest
Hello World! 
----

We have called the `docker run` command which takes care of executing containers. We passed the argument `feelpp/feelpp-env` which is a Feel{plus}{plus} Ubuntu 16.10 container with the required programming and execution environment for Feel{plus}{plus}.
The first line tells us that there is no local copy of this Feel++ image. Docker checks automatically online on the link:http:://hub.docker.com[Docker Hub] if an image is available.

[NOTE]
======
`feelpp/` in `feelpp/feelpp-env` provides the organization name(or namespace) of the image and `feelpp-env` is the image name. Note also that Docker specifies a more complete name `feelpp/feelpp-env:latest` including the tag name `:latest`. We will see later how we defined the `latest` tag at the Feel++ organization. See <<FCS>> for more details.
======

Once the image is downloaded, Docker launches the container and executes the command we provided `echo "Hello World!"` from inside the container. The result of the command is showed on the last line of the output log above.

If you run the command again, you won't see the download part and the command will be executed very fast.

We can ask Docker to give us a shell using the following command
[source,bash]
----
$ docker run -it feelpp/feelpp-env
----
It provides a shell prompt from inside the container which is very similar to what you obtain when login with `ssh` on a remote machine. The flags `-i` and `-t` tell Docker to provide an interactive session (`-i`) with a TTY attached (`-t`).

[[FCS]]
== Feel++ Container System

The _Feel++ Container System_ (FCS) is organized in layers and provide a set of images.

=== Naming

The naming convention of the FCS allows the user to know where they come from and where they are stored on the link:http://hub.docker.com[Docker Hub]. The name of the images is built as follows

[source,bash]
----
feelpp/feelp-<component>[:tag]
----

where 

 * `feelpp/` is the namespace of the image and organization name 
 * `feelpp-<component>` the image name and Feel++ component
 * `[:tag]` an optional tag for the image, by default set to `:latest`
 
Feel++ images(components) are defined as layers in the FCS in the table below

.Table of the current components of the FCS
|===
| Component | Description | Built From

| `feelpp-env` | Execution and Programming environment | <OS> 
| `feelpp-libs`  | Feel++ libraries and tools | `feelpp-env`
| `feelpp-base` | Feel++ base applications | `feelpp-libs` 
| `feelpp-toolboxes` | Feel++ toolboxes   | `feelpp-toolboxes`

|===

| **Note:** `feelpp-env` depends on an operating system image `<OS>`, the recommended and default `<OS>` is Ubuntu 16.10. In the future, we will build upon the next Ubuntu LTS or Debian Stable releases. 

=== Tags

By default, the `:latest` tag is assumed in the name of the images, for example when running
[source,bash]
----
$ docker run -it feelpp/feelpp-apps
----
it is in fact `feelpp/feelpp-apps:latest` which is being launched.
The following table displays the 

|===
| Image |  Built from

| `feelpp-env:latest` | built from Ubuntu 16.10
| `feelpp-libs:latest` | built from `feelpp-env:latest`
| `feelpp-base:latest` | built from `feelpp-libs:latest`
| `feelpp-apps:latest` | built from `feelpp-base:latest`

|===

=== Host OS

As we said before the default Host OS is Ubuntu 16.10. 
However Docker shines in continuous integration. It provides a large set of operating system to build upon and allows to check the software in various context. The FCS takes advantage of Docker to build  `feelpp-libs` for several operating systems provided by `feelpp-env` and with different compilers any time a commit in the Feel++ repository is done.

.Table providing the list of supported Host OS
|===
| Operating system | version | `feelpp-env` Tags | Compilers

| Ubuntu | 16.10 | `ubuntu-16.10`,  `latest` | GCC 6.x, Clang 3.9
| Ubuntu | 16.04 | `ubuntu-16.04` | GCC 6.x, Clang 3.8
| Debian | sid   | `debian-sid` | GCC 6.x, Clang 3.9,4.0
| Debian | testing | `debian-testing`| GCC 6.x, Clang 3.9

|===

If you are interested in testing Feel++ in these systems, you can run these flavors.

=== Containers

==== feelpp-env

`feelpp-env` provides the Host OS and  link:../01-installation/prerequisites.adoc[Feel++ dependencies].

[source,sh]
----
$ docker run feelpp/feelpp-env 
----

==== feelpp-libs

`feelpp-libs` builds from `feelpp-env` and provides:

  . the Feel{plus}{plus} libraries
  . the link:../06-applications/Mesh/Partitioning/readme.adoc[Feel++ mesh partitioner]

[source,sh]
----
$ docker run feelpp/feelpp-libs 
----

==== feelpp-base

`feelpp-base` builds from `feelpp-libs` and provides two basic applications:

 . `feelpp_qs_laplacian_*`: 2D and 3D laplacian problem
 . `feelpp_qs_stokes_*`: 2D and 3D stokes problem

[source,sh]
----
$ docker run feelpp/feelpp-base 
----

==== feelpp-toolboxes

`feelpp-toolboxes` builds from `feelpp-base` and provides

[source,sh]
----
$ docker run feelpp/feelpp-toolboxes 
----


== Runing Feel++ Applications

To run link:/Applications/readme.adoc[Feel{plus}{plus} main applications], you need first to create a directory where you will store the Feel{plus}{plus} simulation files. For example, type
[source,shell]
----
$ mkdir $HOME/feel
----
and then type the following docker command

[source,shell]
----
$ docker run -it -v $HOME/feel:/feel feelpp/feelpp-libs
----

The previous command will execute the latest `feelpp/apps` docker image in interactive mode in a terminal (`-ti`) and mount `$HOME/feel` in the directory `/feel` of the docker image.

Running the command `df` inside the Docker container launched by the previous command
[source,sh]
----
feelpp@4e7b485faf8e:~$ df
----
will get you this kind of output
[source,sh]
----
Filesystem     1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
none           982046716 505681144 426457452  55% /
tmpfs          132020292         0 132020292   0% /dev
tmpfs          132020292         0 132020292   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/sda2      982046716 505681144 426457452  55% /feel
shm                65536         0     65536   0% /dev/shm
----
You see on the last but one line the directory `$HOME/feel` mounted on `/feel` in the Docker image.

IMPORTANT: Note that mouting a host sub-directory on `/feel` is mandatory. If you don't, the Feel++ applications will exit due to lack of permissions.
