== Feel++ Formats

For performance reasons and allow fast checkpoint restart of simulations, we have develop our own mesh and data file format in parallel.

|===
| Format  | Description | Mode | Type 
| `json+hdf5` | Feel++ parallel file format | Read/Write | Metadata & Binary
|===

The format is decomposed into two files : _(i)_ a json file (`.json` file extension) which contain some metadata information on the mesh and _(ii)_ a hdf5 file (`.h5` file extension) which contains the mesh data structure.

== Pre-Processing formats

Feel++ supports various file formats that can be used as input mesh file formats.

|===
| Format  | Description | Mode | Type 
| `acumesh` | Acusim(ALTAIR) mesh file format | Read | Ascii
| `gmsh`  |  Gmsh mesh file format | Read/Write | Ascii/Binary
| `json+hdf5` | Feel++ parallel file format | Read/Write | Metadata & Binary
| `med`  |  MED(Salome) mesh file format | Read/Write | Ascii/Binary
| `mesh`  |  MEDIT(INRIA) mesh file format | Read/Write | Ascii
|===

== Post Processing formats

Feel++ supports various file formats that can be used as output mesh and data file formats for post-processing.

|===
| Format  | Description | Mode | Type 
| `gmsh`  |  Gmsh mesh file format | Read/Write | Ascii/Binary
| `ensightgold` | Ensight  Gold case format | Write | Binary
| `xdmf` | XML/HDF5 file format | Write
| `VTK`   | VTK file format | Write
