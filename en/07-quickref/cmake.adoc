Feel\++ offers a development environment for solving partial differential equations. It uses many tools to cover the different steps  pre-processing, processing and post-processing and large range of numerical methods and needs. To this end it is crucial to have a powerful build environment. Feel\++ uses CMake from Kitware and provides various macros to help setting up your own application or research project.

== CMake macros

=== Setting up Feel++ environment

See section link:../GettingStart/using.adoc:[Using Feel++].

=== Adding a new application

See section link:../GettingStart/using.adoc:[Using Feel++].

=== Adding a new testcase

For a give application or multiple applications you may define testcases. testcases are difrectory containing a set of files that may include geometry, mesh, cfg or json files.

To define a new testcase case, create a sub-directory where your application, say `myapp` like in the previous section, stands and copy the required files there.

```sh
cd <source directory of my application>
mkdir mytestcase
# copy files (.geo, .msh, .cfg...) to mytestcase
...
```
then edit the `CMakeLists.txt` in your application directory and add the following line:

```cmake
feelpp_add_testcase(mytestcase)
```

Then type `make feelpp_add_testcase_mytestcase` in the build directory of your application `myapp`. It will copy in the build directory of your application the directory mytestcase. 

> Note: if you updated the testcase data files, executing `make feelpp_testcase_mytestcase` will use `rsync` to update the files that were changed in the source.

The macro `feelpp_add_testcase` supports options:

* `PREFIX` (default is `feelpp`) set the prefix of the target to avoid eg name clash
```cmake
feelpp_add_testcase(mytestcase PREFIX foo)
```
then the target is `foo_add_testcase_mytestcase`. 

* `DEPS` set the dependencies of the testcase
```cmake
feelpp_add_testcase(mytestcase DEPS myothertestcase)
```
it allows to update a testcase depending on changes in an other one.
