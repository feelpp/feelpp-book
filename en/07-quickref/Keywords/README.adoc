One of Feel{plus}+ assets is it finite element embedded language. The language follows the C++ grammar, and provides keywords as well as operations between objects which are, mathematically, tensors of rank 0, 1 or 2.

In all following tables we use the notations:
$$f: \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{m\times p}$$  
with $$n=1,2,3$$, $$m=1,2,3$$, $$p=1,2,3$$.

We denote $$\Omega^e$$ current mesh element.

The genesis of the language can be found in <<Prudhomme>> paper and an update on Feel++ is available https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00662868[here].
